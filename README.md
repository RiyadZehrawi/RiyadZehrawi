Hello, I'm Riyad Zehrawi.

ðŸŽ“ My Foundation
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, offering me the ability to discern the subtle nuances of client needs and motivations. This journey was further complemented by an immersive bootcamp and internship experience in sales engineering, exposing me to industry-leading platforms like Salesforce and HubSpot.

ðŸ›  Skills & Expertise
Throughout my career, I've gained proficiency in creating engaging product demos, handling discovery calls, navigating objections, and identifying critical pain points. I use these insights to tailor bespoke solutions for clients. My expertise lies in strategically managing the sales process, from prospecting to closing.

ðŸ’¡ Present Focus
At present, I'm venturing into the dynamic field of AI. I am in the process of establishing an automation agency that specialises in creating customer service and prospecting chatbots using Zapier and Botpress. My goal is to help businesses enhance their lead conversion rates, improve time management, accelerate customer support response times, and ultimately reduce operational costs.

ðŸš€ Future Goals
In a business landscape that demands efficiency and exceptional customer experiences, I am committed to harnessing technology to craft solutions that solve real-world challenges and drive business growth.
